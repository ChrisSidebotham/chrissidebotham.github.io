# Me & My Blog ðŸ‘‹

So for those that do not know me, I am Chris Sidebotham, I am based in the UK and I have been around the Managed Service Provider (MSP) industry for most of my career, from IT Support to Project Consultancy. The majority of my professional has been spent dealing with Digital Transformation and Cloud Adoption.
